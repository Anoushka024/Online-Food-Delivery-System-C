## 🍔 Online Food Delivery System in C

This project is a console-based food ordering system developed in the C programming language as part of a Data Structures coursework. It simulates a simple food delivery platform where users can register, login, browse a menu, add items to a cart, place orders, and complete payments — all handled using file I/O and basic data structures.

### 🔧 Features:
- User Registration and Secure Login
- Password Management (Forgot / Change)
- Dynamic Menu Display
- Cart System with Order Confirmation
- Payment Simulation and Order Tracking
- File Handling for Persistent Data

### 📁 Modules:
- `user_management.c` – handles user accounts and authentication
- `Menu.c` – displays and manages food items
- `OT&PS.c` – order tracking and payment system
- `main.c` – ties everything together as the control flow

### 🛠️ Tech:
- Language: C
- Compiler: GCC
- Concepts Used: File Handling, Functions, Modular Programming, Structures

### 🚀 How to Run:
```bash
gcc main.c -o foodapp
./foodapp
